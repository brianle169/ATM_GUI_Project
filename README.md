# ATM GUI Project #

This project attempts to re-create an ATM Graphical User Interface using Java Swing.

The sole purpose of this project is to practice the followings: 
* OOP (inheritance, encapsulation)
* UI design with Java Swing
* Java basics

To test this project, follow these steps:
* Make sure Java is installed on your computer.
* Download this project
* Run "Main.java" file in ATM_GUI package from your command line, or any IDE for Java. (LogIn package is another test project)

One thing to take note. The data file "Bank_LogInData.txt" is empty initially, therefore you should register a new user the first time you test this project, the data will be saved every time you terminate the program so don't worry.

Final words, thank you for trying out my simple project, I appreciate your time and effort :D Have fun!
